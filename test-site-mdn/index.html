FILEPATHRULES
1To link to a target file in the same directory as the
 invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. my-image.jpg.
2To reference a file in a subdirectory, 
write the directory name in front of the path, 
plus a forward slash, e.g. subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
3To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking 
HTML file, write two dots. So for example, if index.html was 
inside a subfolder of test-site and my-image.jpg was inside test-site, 
you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ../my-image.jpg.
4You can combine these as much as you like,
 for example ../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
